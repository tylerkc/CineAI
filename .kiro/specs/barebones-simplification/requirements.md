# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to simplify the CineAI movie recommendation app by removing all complex scoring algorithms, weights, and advanced recommendation logic. The goal is to create a clean, barebones application that focuses on essential functionality: displaying movies, basic recommendations, and allowing users to manage simple lists (watched, blocked, etc.).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simplified movie recommendation interface, so that I can focus on discovering movies without complex algorithms getting in the way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, minimal interface with movie recommendations
2. WHEN displaying movies THEN the system SHALL show only essential information (title, poster, year, genre, basic synopsis)
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use simple, straightforward logic without complex scoring or weighting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage basic movie lists, so that I can track what I've watched and what I want to avoid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a movie THEN the system SHALL provide options to add it to "Watched", "Want to Watch", or "Blocked" lists
2. WHEN I add a movie to a list THEN the system SHALL store this preference locally
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL exclude movies from the "Blocked" list
4. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL deprioritize movies from the "Watched" list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic movie recommendations, so that I can discover new content without overwhelming complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions based on simple criteria (genre similarity, popularity)
2. WHEN no user preferences exist THEN the system SHALL show popular/trending movies
3. WHEN user has watched movies THEN the system SHALL suggest similar genres or related movies
4. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL show a reasonable number (5-10 movies) at a time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove complex recommendation logic, so that the codebase is maintainable and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL remove all scoring algorithms, weights, and complex recommendation engines
2. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL remove unused files related to advanced recommendation features
3. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain only essential recommendation logic
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL preserve the UI components and basic movie data handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast app performance, so that I can browse movies without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL load quickly without complex calculations
2. WHEN switching between movies THEN the system SHALL respond immediately
3. WHEN adding movies to lists THEN the system SHALL update the UI instantly
4. WHEN generating new recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide results without noticeable delay
